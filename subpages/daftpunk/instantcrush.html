                    I didn't want to be the one to forget
                    G
                    I thought of everything I'd never regret
                    F
                    A little time with you is all that I get
                    d
                    That's all we need because it's all we can take
                    
                    a
                    One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
                    G
                    I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground.
                    F
                    I want to take you to that place in the Roche
                    d
                    But no one gives us any time anymore

                    He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
                    G
                    You made an offer for it, then you ran off
                    F
                    I got a picture of us kids in my head
                    d
                    And all I hear is the last thing that you said:

                    Kinda counted on you being a friend

                                            G
                    So I chained myself to a friend

                    You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
                    F
                    The summer memory that just never dies
                    d
                    We worked too long and hard to give it no time
